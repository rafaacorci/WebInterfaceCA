      <h2>Fixed gear bikes: A ride back to simplicity</h2>
        <p>
          Fixed gear bikes, often fondly called <em>fixies</em> are as minimalist as a bicycle can get.
          Unlike modern bicycle, fixed gear bikes have no freehubs mechanisms. This means when the wheels turn,
          so does the pedals. Therefore, there is no coasting when riding them, only pure connection between the rider and the machine.
        </p>
        <h3>A brief history</h3>
        <p>
          The roots of fixed gear bikes can be traced to the early days of cycling in the 19th century. Before derailleurs, gears,
          and multi speed cassettes became the norm, all bikes were in essence fixed gear bikes. They are reliable, simple and easy to maintain.
          These characteristics have led to a modern day resurgence. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Track cyccling brought fixed gear bikes into the competitive scene, with velodrome riders embracing the fixed gear for
          its efficienncy and responsiveness. Over time, urban cyclists, specially bike messengers, adopted the fixed gear bike for their
          low maintenance needs and the raw responsive riding experience they offer.
        </p>

        <h3>Why ride fixies?</h3>
        <p>
          Riding a fixed gear bike is all about control, rhythm, and feel. With fewer components, there's less weight
          and less that can go wrong. Many riders say that riding fixed improves their cadence, handling, and connection
          to the road. Plus, in busy cities, the simplicity of a fixie means more time riding and less time wrenching.

          Riding a fixie is all about control, rhythm and keeping momentum. Due to its minimalist nature, fixies are light and there is 
          very little that can go wrong. Riders describe that riding fixies helped improve their cadence, handling and connection with the bike.
          Additionally, in a urban environment, the simplicity of fixies means that there is more time riding and less time idling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether fixies drawn you due to its elegant lines, tight feedback from the drivertain, or nostalgia to cycling's golden age,
          fixed gear bikes offer a unique experience that isn't easily replicated.
